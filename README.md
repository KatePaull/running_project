This was a passion project to create a half-marathon training schedule and visualize progress toward my half-marathon goal. First, it web-scrapes a running inspirational quote site and randomly selects/displays a quote for encouragement purposes. Then it web scrapes a recommended half-marathon training schedule and updates the formatting and assigns dates to each run. After that, historical run data was imported and extensively cleaned. This cleaning process involved resolving missing data, changing column types and data formats, generating dates/durations/factors/booleans/etc, and generating summary stats. This project ends with some visualizations produced using GGPLOT.
