This project uses data from half-marathon training runs to create a page where progress is visualized and a training schedule is established for personal motivation purposes. The code includes web scraping and randomly sampling from a running inspirational quote website, scraping a recommended training schedule, importing and extensively tidying running data, and visualizing that data.

It shows my ability to tidy data, write functions, work with factors/booleans/dates/times/strings and other types of variables, merge and pivot data, and create GGPLOT graphics including scatter plots, barplots, and box and whisker plots, and how to display them using facet wrapping and Quarto tabsets.
